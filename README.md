Raysect Python Raytracing Package
=================================

A ray-tracing framework for optical/non-optical physics simulations.

The aims of the Raysect project are as follows:

* develop a ray-tracer that is easy for scientists and engineers to use and extend

* the raytracer must be robust and high precision

The general development philosophy is ease of use trumps performance, but performance is not to be ignored.

Please note, this code is currently under heavy development and subject to change.

Raysect currently only supports Linux. Windows support will come at a later stage.

Please note, for legal reasons we require the copyright to any contributed code to be passed to the Raysect project. Please see CONTRIBUTING.txt in the repository.
