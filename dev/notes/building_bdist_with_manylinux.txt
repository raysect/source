Install docker:

    sudo apt install docker.io

Create a temporary folder, enter it and clone the new release:

    git clone git@github.com:raysect/source.git

Start the manylinux docker container (this will download the container, mount the current folder as "io", and start an interactive session):

    sudo docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/io quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64 /bin/bash

This will drop you into the manylinux container terminal. The /opt/python folder in the container holds the various versions of python. This example targets python 3.7. Adjust the paths as appropriate to build bdists for different python versions.

    cd io/source
    /opt/python/cp37-cp37m/bin/python -m pip install cython numpy==1.14.6
    /opt/python/cp37-cp37m/bin/python setup.py bdist_wheel
    auditwheel repair dist/raysect-0.6.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl

This will compile the wheel and repair any library references to produce the manylinux wheel files in a folder ./wheelhouse. e.g. raysect-0.6.1-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl and raysect-0.6.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl.

These can then be uploaded to pypi (just the manylinux1 packages for now).
