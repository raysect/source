cdef class TargettedCCDArray(Observer2D):
    """
    An ideal CCD-like imaging sensor that preferentially targets a given list of primitives.

    The targetted CCD is a regular array of square pixels. Each pixel samples red, green
    and blue channels (behaves like a Foveon imaging sensor). The CCD sensor
    width is specified with the width parameter. The CCD height is calculated
    from the width and the number of vertical and horizontal pixels. The
    default width and sensor ratio approximates a 35mm camera sensor.

    The targetted CCD takes a list of target primitives. Each pixel will target the
    bounding spheres that encompass each target primitive. Therefore, for best performance,
    the target primitives should be split up such that their surfaces are closely wrapped
    by the bounding sphere.

    The sampling algorithm fires a proportion of rays at the targets, and a portion sampled
    from the full hemisphere. The proportion that is fired towards the targets is controlled
    with the targetted_path_prob attribute. By default this attribute is set to 0.9, i.e.
    90% of the rays are fired towards the targets.

    .. Warning..
       If the target probability is set to 1, rays will only be fired directly towards the
       targets. The user must ensure there are no sources of radiance outside of the
       targeted directions, otherwise they will not be sampled and the result will be biased.

    :param list targets: The list of primitives for targetted sampling.
    :param tuple pixels: A tuple of pixel dimensions for the camera (default=(512, 512)).
    :param float width: The CCD sensor x-width in metres (default=35mm).
    :param list pipelines: The list of pipelines that will process the spectrum measured
      at each pixel by the camera (default=RGBPipeline2D()).
