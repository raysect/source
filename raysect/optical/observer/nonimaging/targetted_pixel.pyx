cdef class TargettedPixel(Observer0D):
    """
    A pixel observer that preferentially targets rays towards a given list of primitives.

    The targetted pixel takes a list of target primitives. The observer targets the
    bounding sphere that encompasses a target primitive. Therefore, for best performance,
    the target primitives should be split up such that their surfaces are closely wrapped
    by the bounding sphere.

    The sampling algorithm fires a proportion of rays at the targets, and a portion sampled
    from the full hemisphere. The proportion that is fired towards the targets is controlled
    with the targetted_path_prob attribute. By default this attribute is set to 0.9, i.e.
    90% of the rays are fired towards the targets.

    .. Warning..
       If the target probability is set to 1, rays will only be fired directly towards the
       targets. The user must ensure there are no sources of radiance outside of the
       targeted directions, otherwise they will not be sampled and the result will be biased.

    :param list targets: The list of primitives for targeted sampling.
    :param float targetted_path_prob: The probability of sampling a targeted primitive VS sampling over the whole hemisphere.
    :param list pipelines: The list of pipelines that will process the spectrum measured
      by this pixel (default=SpectralPipeline0D()).
    :param float x_width: The rectangular collection area's width along the
      x-axis in local coordinates (default=1cm).
    :param float y_width: The rectangular collection area's width along the
      y-axis in local coordinates (default=1cm).
