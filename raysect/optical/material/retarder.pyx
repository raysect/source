    An ideal optical retarder.

    The retarder material behaves as an idealised uni-axial crystal. Light
    passing through the retarder experiences a change of phase, determined
    by the angle of propagation vs the retarder axis. The phase shift has
    no wavelength dependence.

    The retarder axis defines the "fast" axis of propagation. Light with an
    electric field aligned with the axis propagates faster than light with
    an electric field perpendicular to the axis (the "slow" axes).

    The phase shift parameter defines the amount of phase shift introduced
    per meter of propagation though the material for a ray propagating
    perpendicular to the retarder axis. The accumulated phase shift reduces
    according to the sin of the angle between the ray direction and the
    optical axis.
