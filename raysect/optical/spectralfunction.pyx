cdef class SpectralFunction:
    """
    SpectralFunction abstract base class.

    A common interface for representing optical properties that are a function
    of wavelength. It provides methods for sampling, integrating and averaging
    a spectral function over specified wavelength ranges. The optical package
    uses SpectralFunctions to represent a number of different wavelength
    dependent optical properties, for example emission spectra, refractive
    indices and attenuation curves.

    Deriving classes must implement the integrate method.

    It is also recommended that subclasses implement __call__(). This should
    accept a single argument - wavelength - and return a single sample of the
    function at that wavelength. The units of wavelength are nanometers.

    A number of utility sub-classes exist to simplify SpectralFunction
    development.
