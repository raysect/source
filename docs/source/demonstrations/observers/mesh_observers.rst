Mesh Observers
==============

In this example we demonstrate two different types of observations
on a mesh surface. The first case measures the total power arriving
on a mesh surface. The second case treats each triangle in a mesh as
an observing pixel and saves the resulting power on the mesh to a
vtk data file for later visualisation in paraview.
