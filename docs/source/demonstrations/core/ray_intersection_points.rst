Ray Intersection Points
=======================

Rays are launched in the same way as the pinhole camera. The simple scene consists
of the Stanford bunny model sitting on a platform. For every ray that is launched,
the cartesian hit point of the ray with the materials in the scene (rabit and floor)
is recorded. In Figure 1 the 3D hit point for each ray in the camera is plotted in
3D space. In Figure 2 the z coordinate of each hit point is scaled and plotted to
indicate distance from the camera. Both methods allow simple visualisation of a
scene and extraction of intersection geometry data.

   The 3D intersection point of each camera ray with the materials in the scene is
   recorded and plotted as 3D points.

   The Z coordinate of each intersection point is scaled and plotted to
   indicate distance from the camera. This allows a crude form of scene
   visualisation.
