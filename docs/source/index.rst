Welcome
=======

Welcome to Raysect, an OOP ray-tracing framework for Python. Raysect has been built with scientific ray-tracing in mind. Some of its features include:

* Fully spectral, high precision. Supports scientific ray-tracing of spectra from physical light sources such as plasmas.
* All core loops are written in cython for speed.
* Easily extensible, written with user customisation of materials and emissive sources in mind.
* Different observer types supported such as Pinhole cameras and optical fibres.
