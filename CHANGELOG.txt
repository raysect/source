New:
* Diamond demo.


Release 0.3.0 (8 Mar 2017)
--------------------------

New:
* Added multiple importance sampling (MIS).
* Added micro-facet based materials.
* Added 2D kd-tree and 2D mesh utilities
* Added parabola primitive.
* Added spherical lens primitives.
* Added render engine workflow model with engines targetting single core and multicore rendering.
* Added StatsBin and StatsArray objects.

Changes:
* Completely re-engineered optical observers.
  - New pipeline architecture.
  - Adaptive sampling.
  - Framework simplifies development of new observers.
* Re-engineered spectral functions (API changes are minimal).
* Renamed num_samples and spectral_samples to bins and spectral_bins.
* Renamed ray_min_depth to ray_extinction_min_depth.
* Optimised the codebase for greater rendering performance.
* Updated lambert material to support MIS.
* Tidied up numerous internal interfaces.
